INTRODUCTION                                    *fugitive*

Install in ~/.vim, or in ~\vimfiles if you're on Windows and feeling lucky.
Vim 7.2 is recommended as it ships with syntax highlighting for many Git file
types.

If you're in a hurry to get started, here are some things to try:

In any file in your repository, run |:Gedit| HEAD.  Press <CR> to jump to the
current branch.  Press <CR> again to jump to the top most commit.  Keep using
<CR> to explore parent commits, trees, and blobs.  Use C in a tree or blob to
get back to the commit.

Edit a file in the work tree and make some changes.  Use |:Gdiff| to open up
the indexed version.  Use |do| and |dp| on various hunks to bring the files in
sync, or use |:Gread| to pull in all changes.  Write the indexed version to
stage the file.

Run |:Gstatus| to check your repository's status.  Use "-" to stage and reset
files and "p" to add/reset --patch them.  Invoke |:Gcommit| to commit your
changes.

Run |:Gblame| in a work tree file to see a blame in a vertical split.  Press
<CR> on any line to reopen and reblame that file as it stood in that commit.
Press o or O on any line to inspect that commit in a split or a tab.

Run |:Ggrep| to search the work tree or history.  Run |:Gmove| to rename a
file.  Run |:Gremove| to delete a file.

COMMANDS                                        *fugitive-commands*

These commands are local to the buffers in which they work (generally, buffers
that are part of Git repositories).

                                                *fugitive-:Git*
:Git [args]             Run an arbitrary git command. Similar to :!git [args]
                        but chdir to the repository tree first.

                                                *fugitive-:Gcd*
:Gcd [directory]        |:cd| relative to the repository.

                                                *fugitive-:Glcd*
:Glcd [directory]       |:lcd| relative to the repository.

                                                *fugitive-:Gstatus*
:Gstatus                Bring up the output of git-status in the preview
                        window.  In addition to standard motions, you can
                        use <C-N> and <C-P> to jump from filename to
                        filename.  Press D to |:Gdiff| the file on the cursor
                        line, or dh to |:Gdiff!|.  Press - to stage or unstage
                        the file on the cursor line.  Press p to do so on a
                        per hunk basis (--patch).  Press C to invoke
                        |:Gcommit|.

                                                *fugitive-:Gcommit*
:Gcommit [args]         A wrapper around git-commit.  If there is nothing
                        to commit, |:Gstatus| is called instead.  Unless the
                        arguments given would skip the invocation of an editor
                        (e.g., -m), a split window will be used to obtain a
                        commit message.  Write and close that window (:wq or
                        |:Gwrite|) to finish the commit.  Unlike when running
                        the actual git-commit command, it is possible (but
                        unadvisable) to muck with the index with commands like
                        git-add and git-reset while a commit message is
                        pending.

                                                *fugitive-:Ggrep*
:Ggrep [args]           |:grep| with git-grep as 'grepprg'.

                                                *fugitive-:Glog*
:Glog [args]            Load all previous revisions of the current file into
                        the quickfix list.  Additional git-log arguments can
                        be given (for example, --reverse).  If "--" appears as
                        an argument, no file specific filtering is done, and
                        commits are loaded into the quickfix list.

                                        *fugitive-:Gedit* *fugitive-:Ge*
:Gedit [revision]       |:edit| a |fugitive-revision|.

                                                *fugitive-:Gsplit*
:Gsplit [revision]      |:split| a |fugitive-revision|.

                                                *fugitive-:Gvsplit*
:Gvsplit [revision]     |:vsplit| a |fugitive-revision|.

                                                *fugitive-:Gtabedit*
:Gtabedit [revision]    |:tabedit| a |fugitive-revision|

                                                *fugitive-:Gpedit*
:Gpedit [revision]      |:pedit| a |fugitive-revision|

                                                *fugitive-:Gread*
:Gread [revision]       Empty the buffer and |:read| a |fugitive-revision|.
                        When the argument is omitted, this is similar to
                        git-checkout on a work tree file or git-add on a stage
                        file, but without writing anything to disk.

:{range}Gread [revision]
                        |:read| in a |fugitive-revision| after {range}.

                                                *fugitive-:Gread!*
:Gread! [revision]      Deprecated synonym for |:Gread|.

                                                *fugitive-:Gwrite*
:Gwrite                 Write to the current file's path and stage the results.
                        When run in a work tree file, it is effectively git
                        add.  Elsewhere, it is effectively git-checkout.  A
                        great deal of effort is expended to behave sensibly
                        when the work tree or index version of the file is
                        open in another buffer.

:Gwrite {path}          You can give |:Gwrite| an explicit path of where in
                        the work tree to write.  You can also give a path like
                        :0:foo.txt or even :0 to write to just that stage in
                        the index.

                                                *fugitive-:Gdiff*
:Gdiff [revision]       Perform a |vimdiff| against the current file in the
                        given revision.  With no argument, the version in the
                        index is used (which means a three-way diff during a
                        merge conflict, making it a git-mergetool
                        alternative).  The newer of the two files is placed
                        to the right.  Use |do| and |dp| and write to the
                        index file to simulate "git add --patch".

                                                *fugitive-:Gdiff!*
:Gdiff! [revision]      Like |:Gdiff|, but split horizontally.

                                                *fugitive-:Gmove*
:Gmove {destination}    Wrapper around git-mv that renames the buffer
                        afterward.  The destination is relative to the current
                        directory except when started with a /, in which case
                        it is relative to the work tree.  Add a ! to pass -f.

                                                *fugitive-:Gremove*
:Gremove                Wrapper around git-rm that deletes the buffer
                        afterward.  When invoked in an index file, --cached is
                        passed.  Add a ! to pass -f and forcefully discard the
                        buffer.

                                                *fugitive-:Gblame*
:Gblame [flags]         Run git-blame on the file and open the results in a
                        scroll bound vertical split.  Press enter on a line to
                        reblame the file as it was in that commit.  You can
                        give any of ltwfsMC as flags and they will be passed
                        along to git-blame.

:[range]Gblame [flags]  Run git-blame on the given range.

                                                *fugitive-:Gbrowse*
:[range]Gbrowse         If the remote for the current branch is on GitHub,
                        open the current file, blob, tree, commit, or tag
                        (with git-web--browse) on GitHub.  Otherwise, open the
                        current file, blob, tree, commit, or tag in
                        git-instaweb (if you have issues, verify you can run
                        "git instaweb" from a terminal).  If a range is given,
                        it is appropriately appended to the URL as an anchor.

:[range]Gbrowse!        Like :Gbrowse, but put the URL on the clipboard rather
                        than opening it.

:[range]Gbrowse -       Like :Gbrowse, but tie the URL to the current HEAD.
                        This is useful in a work tree file to ensure the link
                        always goes to the file as it currently stands, rather
                        than whatever the latest on master is.  Note that
                        when editing a historical file, said link is tied by
                        default to the commit you're currently browsing.  (The
                        intent is that ultimately, one will be able to specify
                        any |fugitive-revision| here, but the current
                        implementation is limited to this one special case.)

[range]Gbrowse [...]@{remote}
                        Force using the given remote rather than the remote
                        for the current branch.  The remote is used to
                        determine which GitHub repository to link to.

SPECIFYING REVISIONS                            *fugitive-revision*

Fugitive revisions are similar to Git revisions as defined in the "SPECIFYING
REVISIONS" section in the git-rev-parse man page.  For commands that accept an
optional revision, the default is the file in the index for work tree files
and the work tree file for everything else.  Example revisions follow.

Revision        Meaning ~
HEAD            .git/HEAD
master          .git/refs/heads/master
HEAD^{}         The commit referenced by HEAD
HEAD^           The parent of the commit referenced by HEAD
HEAD:           The tree referenced by HEAD
/HEAD           The file named HEAD in the work tree
Makefile        The file named Makefile in the work tree
HEAD^:Makefile  The file named Makefile in the parent of HEAD
:Makefile       The file named Makefile in the index (writable)
-               The current file in HEAD
^               The current file in the previous commit
~3              The current file 3 commits ago
:               .git/index (Same as |:Gstatus|)
:0              The current file in the index
:1              The current file's common ancestor during a conflict
:2              The current file in the target branch during a conflict
:3              The current file in the merged branch during a conflict
:/foo           The most recent commit with "foo" in the message

STATUSLINE                                      *fugitive-statusline*

                                                *fugitive#statusline()*
Add %{fugitive#statusline()} to your statusline to get an indicator including
the current branch and the currently edited file's commit.  If you don't have
a statusline, this one matches the default when 'ruler' is set:
>
    set statusline=%<%f\ %h%m%r%{fugitive#statusline()}%=%-14.(%l,%c%V%)\ %P
<
