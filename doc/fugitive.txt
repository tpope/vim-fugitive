INTRODUCTION                                    *fugitive*

Install in ~/.vim, or in ~\vimfiles if you're on Windows and feeling lucky.
Vim 7.2 is recommended as it ships with syntax highlighting for many Git file
types.

If you're in a hurry to get started, here are some things to try:

In any file in your repository, run |:Gedit| HEAD.  Press <CR> to jump to the
current branch.  Press <CR> again to jump to the top most commit.  Keep using
<CR> to explore parent commits, trees, and blobs.  Use C in a tree or blob to
get back to the commit.

Edit a file in the work tree and make some changes.  Use |:Gdiff| to open up
the indexed version.  Use |do| and |dp| on various hunks to bring the files in
sync, or use |:Gread!| to pull in all changes.  Write the indexed version to
stage the file.

Run |:Gblame| in a work tree file to see a blame in a vertical split.  Press
<CR> on any line to reopen and reblame that file as it stood in that commit.
Press o or O on any line to inspect that commit in a split or a tab.

Run |:Ggrep| to search the work tree or history.  Run |:Gmove| to rename a
file.  Run |:Gremove| to delete a file.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                        *fugitive-commands*

These commands are local to the buffers in which they work (generally, buffers
that are part of Git repositories).

                                                *fugitive-:Git*
:Git [args]             Run an arbitrary git command. Similar to :!git [args]
                        but chdir to the repository tree first.

                                                *fugitive-:Gcd*
:Gcd [directory]        |:cd| relative to the repository.

                                                *fugitive-:Glcd*
:Glcd [directory]       |:lcd| relative to the repository.

                                                *fugitive-:Gstatus*
:Gstatus                Bring up the output of git status in the preview
                        window.  Press - to stage or unstage the file on the
                        cursor line.

                                                *fugitive-:Ggrep*
:Ggrep [args]           |:grep| with git-grep as 'grepprg'.

                                                *fugitive-:Glog*
:Glog [args]            Load all previous revisions of the current file into
                        the quickfix list.  Additional git-log arguments can
                        be given (for example, --reverse).  If "--" appears as
                        an argument, no file specific filtering is done, and
                        commits are loaded into the quickfix list.

                                        *fugitive-:Gedit* *fugitive-:Ge*
:Gedit [revision]       |:edit| a |fugitive-revision|.

                                                *fugitive-:Gsplit*
:Gsplit [revision]      |:split| a |fugitive-revision|.

                                                *fugitive-:Gvsplit*
:Gvsplit [revision]     |:vsplit| a |fugitive-revision|.

                                                *fugitive-:Gtabedit*
:Gtabedit [revision]    |:tabedit| a |fugitive-revision|

                                                *fugitive-:Gpedit*
:Gpedit [revision]      |:pedit| a |fugitive-revision|

                                                *fugitive-:Gread*
:Gread [revision]       |:read| a |fugitive-revision|

                                                *fugitive-:Gread!*
:Gread! [revision]      Empty the buffer and |:read| a |fugitive-revision|.
                        This is similar to git checkout on a work tree file or
                        git add on a stage file, but without writing anything
                        to disk.

                                                *fugitive-:Gwrite*
:Gwrite                 Write to the current file's path and stage the results.
                        When run in a work tree file, it is effectively git
                        add.  Elsewhere, it is effectively git checkout.  A
                        great deal of effort is expended to behave sensibly
                        when the work tree or index version of the file is
                        open in another buffer.

:Gwrite {path}          You can give |:Gwrite| an explicit path of where in
                        the work tree to write.  You can also give a path like
                        :0:foo.txt or even :0 to write to just that stage in
                        the index.

                                                *fugitive-:Gdiff*
:Gdiff [revision]       Perform a |vimdiff| against the current file in the
                        given revision.  With no argument, the version in the
                        index is used (which means a three-way diff during a
                        merge conflict, making it a git mergetool
                        alternative).  Use |do| and |dp| and write to the
                        index file to simulate git add -p.

                                                *fugitive-:Gmove*
:Gmove {destination}    Wrapper around git-mv that renames the buffer
                        afterward.  The destination is relative to the current
                        directory except when started with a /, in which case
                        it is relative to the work tree.  Add a ! to pass -f.

                                                *fugitive-:Gremove*
:Gremove                Wrapper around git-rm that deletes the buffer
                        afterward.  When invoked in an index file, --cached is
                        passed.  Add a ! to pass -f and forcefully discard the
                        buffer.

                                                *fugitive-:Gblame*
:Gblame                 Run git-blame on the file and open the results in a
                        scroll bound vertical split.  Press enter on a line to
                        reblame the file as it was in that commit.

:[range]Gblame          Run git-blame on the given range.

SPECIFYING REVISIONS                            *fugitive-revision*

Fugitive revisions are similar to Git revisions as defined in the "SPECIFYING
REVISIONS" section in the git-rev-parse man page.  For commands that accept an
optional revision, the default is the file in the index for work tree files
and the work tree file for everything else.  Example revisions follow.

Revision        Meaning ~
HEAD            .git/HEAD
master          .git/refs/heads/master
HEAD^{}         The commit referenced by HEAD
HEAD^           The parent of the commit referenced by HEAD
HEAD:           The tree referenced by HEAD
/HEAD           The file named HEAD in the work tree
Makefile        The file named Makefile in the work tree
HEAD^:Makefile  The file named Makefile in the parent of HEAD
:Makefile       The file named Makefile in the index (writable)
-               The current file in HEAD
^               The current file in the previous commit
~3              The current file 3 commits ago
:               .git/index (Same as |:Gstatus|)
:0              The current file in the index
:1              The current file's common ancestor during a conflict
:2              The current file in the target branch during a conflict
:3              The current file in the merged branch during a conflict
:/foo           The most recent commit with "foo" in the message
